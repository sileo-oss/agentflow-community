Please focus ONLY on tools that are part of AgentFlow itself (like workflow execution and validation, fetch and search, etc.), not general MCP servers or external integrations.\n\nFor each AgentFlow tool, explain:\n1. What the tool does\n2. When I should use it\n3. A simple example of how it works\n\nKeep explanations concise and practical. This will help me understand AgentFlow's core capabilities."
