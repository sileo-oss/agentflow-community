  "content": "Analyze the current project with a focus on architectural quality. Your goal is to identify any problematic abstractions, violations of separation of concerns, or areas where responsibilities are poorly defined or overly coupled.\n\nPlease perform the following:\n\nAnalyze the code structure: Look at how modules, classes, and functions are organized. Identify any areas where logic is mixed across layers (e.g., business logic in UI components, data access in service layers).\n\nDetect abstraction issues: Highlight any abstractions that are leaky, unnecessary, or overly generic. Point out places where abstractions obscure intent or make the code harder to maintain.\n\nEvaluate separation of concerns: Identify where responsibilities are blurred or where components take on multiple roles (e.g., a controller that also handles persistence or validation).\n\nRank issues by severity: Provide a prioritized list of architectural concerns, from most critical to least, based on their impact on maintainability, scalability, and readability.\n\nRecommend improvements: For each issue, suggest concrete refactoring strategies or design patterns that would improve the separation of concerns and abstraction quality.\n\nAssume the code is part of a production system that needs to be maintainable and extensible. Be thorough and opinionated in your analysis."
