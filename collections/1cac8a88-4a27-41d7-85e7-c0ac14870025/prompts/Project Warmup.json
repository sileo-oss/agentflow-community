  "content": "Before I ask for any changes or new feature implementations, I want you to fully understand the current state of this project.\n\nPlease:\n1. Analyze all available files, folders, and documentation in this workspace.\n2. Identify the main purpose of the project, its architecture, key components, and any frameworks or libraries in use.\n3. Review all documentation \u2014 including README files, design docs, API references, and inline comments \u2014 to understand the project's goals, constraints, and intended usage.\n4. Note any configuration files, environment settings, and build/deployment scripts.\n5. Understand the naming conventions, code style, and any patterns or abstractions used.\n6. Summarize the roles of major modules/classes/functions and how they interact.\n7. Flag any areas that seem incomplete, deprecated, or under development.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve built a complete internal understanding, let me know you're ready. I\u2019ll then ask you to help with a new feature or improvement.\n\nAssume that your context window should include all relevant files, documentation, and dependencies needed to reason about the project holistically."
