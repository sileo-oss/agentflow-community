  "description": "A universal onboarding instruction that directs the agent to study the codebase, generate an accurate AGENTS.md file, and create a structured agent_docs/ directory with project‑specific documentation for build, test, deploy, architecture, and other workflows.",
  "content": "You are tasked with onboarding yourself into this codebase by creating an agent_docs/ directory \nwith accurate documentation files, and then writing a concise AGENTS.md file that references them.\n\nCore Principles:\n- These documents are written for AGENTS, not humans. \n- Keep everything as concise as possible. \n- AGENTS.md must be significantly shorter than the 300-line maximum — aim for brevity. \n- Minimize inline commands in AGENTS.md. Instead, reference agent_docs/ files where details live.\n- Only include universally relevant information in AGENTS.md. Push all specifics into agent_docs/.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Study the Codebase\n   - Inspect repo structure, source files, configs, and scripts.\n   - Identify tech stack, dependencies, build/test/deploy workflows.\n\n2. Create agent_docs/ Directory\n   - Generate project-specific documentation files based on what you discover.\n   - All files are optional — only create those relevant to this project.\n   - Common examples:\n     - build.md → build/run instructions\n     - test.md → test workflows, CI/CD\n     - deploy.md → deployment/release process\n     - architecture.md → modules, services, dependencies\n     - database.md → schema/migrations (if applicable)\n     - style.md → coding conventions (if not enforced elsewhere)\n   - Each file should be accurate, concise, and cross-checked against the codebase.\n\n3. Create AGENTS.md (root of repo)\n   - Keep it short and agent-friendly.\n   - Summarize WHY (purpose), WHAT (stack/structure), HOW (basic workflows).\n   - Reference agent_docs/ files instead of duplicating details.\n   - Avoid long command lists — include only minimal universal commands.\n\n4. Writing Guidelines\n   - Use clear headings and bullet points.\n   - Ensure accuracy by cross-checking with actual code/config files.\n   - Keep explanations practical but concise.\n   - Do not include style/linter rules in AGENTS.md.\n\n5. Output\n   - Deliver AGENTS.md with links to each agent_docs file you created.\n   - Populate agent_docs files with accurate, project-specific documentation.\n   - Ensure everything is consistent, concise, and optimized for agent consumption."
